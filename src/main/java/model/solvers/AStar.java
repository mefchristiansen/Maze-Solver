/**
 * A SwingWorker class (extending MazeGeneratorWorker) that implements the A* graph traversal and path finding
 * algorithm. A* aims to find the path to the end point with the smallest cost (in this case, the shortest distance).
 * At each iteration, the algorithm chooses the path that minimizes a cost function: f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is
 * the cost to the current node from the root node and h(n) is the estimate of the remaining cost to the end node using a heuristic. In
 * this case, the heuristic (i.e. estimated cost), is the Manhattan Distance between the current and end node. Unlike
 * BFS and DFS, A* is an informed search algorithm, meaning that it knows where the end node is, and uses this knowledge
 * to make an informed guess as to which path is most efficient.
