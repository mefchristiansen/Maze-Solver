 * MazeSolver --- A maze solver application that automatically generates a random maze, and then proceeds to traverse
 * and solve the maze using a variety of graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*). This generation and traversal is
 * visualized using JSwing, and allows the user to interact with the maze, enabling them to choose the size of the maze,
 * the maze start and end points, the solution algorithm, as well as vary the animation speed.
